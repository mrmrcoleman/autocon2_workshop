# NetBox Automation - Zero to Hero

Welcome to NetBox Automation - Zero to Hero! In this workshop we will build a fully functioning intent-based network automation stack. While most vendors do a great job of showing you how to use their tool, network automation is a multi-tool adventure and there is lack of tutorials and documentation showing how everything fits together.

This workshop is intended to teach you the high-level concepts around intent-based networking, while also delivering you a fully functioning stack you can continue to experiment with. The workshop is split into sections covering different elements of the story. You should follow them sequentially.
